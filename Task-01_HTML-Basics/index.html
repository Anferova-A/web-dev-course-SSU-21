   <h2><a name="Early years">Early years</a></h2> 
   <time datetime="1799-06-06">6 June 1799</time>
   <p>I was born in Moscow and my life started.</p>
    <p>In summer I was usually sent to his grandmother's. She often mentioned I taste for books.</p>
    <p>In 1811 I entered the newly founded Imperial Lyceum in Tsarskoye Selo. At the Lyceum I wrote my first poems.
        Also at that time I published one of my poems in Moscow magazine Vestnik Evropy. While studying at the Lyceum, I became a member of Arzamas, a literary society.</p>
    
    <h2><a name="Beginning">Beginning of Pushkin's career</a></h2>
    <p>After graduating from the Lyceum Pushkin became a member of another society called the Green Lamp. At the same time he made friends with the people from Decembrist
         communities. In 1820, Pushkin published his poem Ruslan and Lyudmila. It didn't get a lot of positive feedback.</p>
    <p>Soon after its publication, Pushkin was sent into exile in southern Russia. He traveled to the Caucasus and, then, to the Crimea with the intention of recovering
         from his pneumonia. During the exile Pushkin began work on his masterpiece, Eugene Onegin.</p>

    <h2><a name="Mikhailovskoye">Mikhailovskoye</a></h2>
    <p>Mikhailovskoye was his mother's rural estate. He was sent there into exile from 1824 to 1826. That time was very productive in the poet's life. In Mikhailovskoye, in 1825,
        Pushkin wrote the poem To***. It is generally believed that he dedicated this poem to Anna Kern.</p>

    <h2><a name="Death">Death</a></h2>
    <p>In 1831, Pushkin married Natalia Goncharova. Georges d'Anthès openly pursued Natalia for years. Pushkin eventually challenged d’Anthès to a duel, which he lost.
         Pushkin was mortally wounded and died two days after the duel on 10 February 1837.</p>
