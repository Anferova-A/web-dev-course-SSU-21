   <p>I was born in Moscow and my life started.</p>
    <p>In summer I was usually sent to his grandmother's. She often mentioned I taste for books.</p>
    <p>In 1811 I entered the newly founded Imperial Lyceum in Tsarskoye Selo. At the Lyceum I wrote my first poems.
        Also at that time I published one of my poems in Moscow magazine Vestnik Evropy. While studying at the Lyceum, I became a member of Arzamas, a literary society.</p>
